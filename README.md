## Bio

Hi, there. I'm Miles, a web developer from Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

I'm [a writer for people](http://miles.ink/) and [a writer for computers](https://github.com/awayken). I seemed destined to spend my time at a keyboard.

In my work time, I lead a team of frontend developers where we're building user interfaces using Angular.

In my personal time, I write poetry, short stories and novels. So, I'm like a really legit writer who can write good and stuff.

I'm self-motivated and self-disciplined. My goal with every project is producing the best product for the end user. I try to achieve this by writing my own code, adhering to HTML standards and best practices, and constantly and tirelessly learning and growing my craft.
